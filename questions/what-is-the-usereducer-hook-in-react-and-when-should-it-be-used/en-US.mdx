title: What is the `useReducer` hook in React and when should it be used?
---

## TL;DR

The `useReducer` hook in React is used for managing complex state logic in functional components. It is an alternative to `useState` and is particularly useful when the state has multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. It takes a reducer function and an initial state as arguments and returns the current state and a dispatch function.

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

Use `useReducer` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous state.

## What is the `useReducer` hook in React and when should it be used?

### Introduction to `useReducer`

The `useReducer` hook is a React hook that is used for managing state in functional components. It is an alternative to the `useState` hook and is particularly useful for managing more complex state logic. The `useReducer` hook is similar to the `reduce` function in JavaScript arrays, where you have a reducer function that determines how the state should change in response to actions.

### Syntax

The `useReducer` hook takes two arguments: a reducer function and an initial state. It returns an array with the current state and a dispatch function.

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

### Reducer function

The reducer function is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state. The action is an object that typically has a `type` property and an optional `payload`.

```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}
```

### Example usage

Here is a simple example of using `useReducer` to manage a counter state:

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### When to use `useReducer`

- **Complex state logic**: Use `useReducer` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous state.
- **State management**: It is useful when you need a more predictable state management pattern, similar to Redux.
- **Performance optimization**: `useReducer` can help optimize performance in certain scenarios by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
